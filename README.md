## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/chelsy-s/midTerm.git
   cd midTerm
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Environment Variables

The application can be configured using these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Running environment (DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, PRODUCTION) | PRODUCTION |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) | INFO |

You can set these variables in a `.env` file in the project root directory.

## Design Patterns

### Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates operations as objects, enabling:
- Parameterization of clients with different requests
- Queueing or logging of requests
- Support for undoable operations

**Implementation**: [app/commands/__init__.py](app/commands/__init__.py)

```python
class Command(ABC):
    """
    Command Pattern: Abstract base class for all commands.
    """
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass

class CommandHandler:
    """CommandHandler manages and executes commands."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.commands = {}
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def register_command(self, command_name: str, command: Command):
        self.commands[command_name] = command
```

### Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which classes to instantiate. This is implemented in the calculator operations:

**Implementation**: [app/plugins/operations/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/__init__.py)

```python
class OperationFactory:
    """
    Factory Method pattern implementation for creating operations.
    """
    _operations: Dict[str, Type[Operation]] = {}
    
    @classmethod
    def register_operation(cls, name: str, operation_class: Type[Operation]) -> None:
        cls._operations[name] = operation_class
    
    @classmethod
    def create_operation(cls, name: str) -> Optional[Operation]:
        if name in cls._operations:
            return cls._operations[name]()
        return None
```

### Plugin System

The application uses a dynamic plugin system to load command implementations at runtime:

**Implementation**: [app/__init__.py](app/__init__.py)

This design allows for extending the application's functionality without modifying core code.

## Error Handling Approaches

The application demonstrates two complementary error handling approaches:

### Look Before You Leap (LBYL)

The LBYL approach checks conditions before performing an operation:

```python
# LBYL approach in CommandHandler.execute_command
if command_name in self.commands:
    return self.commands[command_name].execute(*args, **kwargs)
else:
    return f"No such command: {command_name}"
```

### Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP)

The EAFP approach uses try/except to handle errors after they occur:

```python
# EAFP approach in CommandHandler.execute_command_eafp
try:
    return self.commands[command_name].execute(*args, **kwargs)
except KeyError:
    return f"No such command: {command_name}"
except Exception as e:
    return f"Error executing command {command_name}: {str(e)}"
```

## Calculator Operations

The calculator implements four basic operations as plugins:

1. **Addition**: Adds two or more numbers together
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/add/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/add/__init__.py)

2. **Subtraction**: Subtracts numbers from the first operand
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/subtract/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/subtract/__init__.py)

3. **Multiplication**: Multiplies two or more numbers together
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/multiply/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/multiply/__init__.py)

4. **Division**: Divides the first operand by subsequent operands
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/divide/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/divide/__init__.py)
   - Special handling for division by zero

Each operation implements validation to ensure proper arguments and error handling.

## Logging Implementation

The application implements a comprehensive logging system that:

1. Configures logging based on logging.conf file
2. Falls back to basic configuration if the file is missing
3. Adjusts log levels based on environment variables
4. Uses rotating file handlers to manage log size
5. Differentiates log messages by severity

**Implementation**: [app/__init__.py](app/__init__.py) and [logging.conf](logging.conf)

```python
def configure_logging(self):
    """Configure the logging system based on logging.conf."""
    logging_conf_path = 'logging.conf'
    if os.path.exists(logging_conf_path):
        logging.config.fileConfig(logging_conf_path, disable_existing_loggers=False)
    else:
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    
    # Dynamic log level based on environment variable if set
    env_log_level = os.environ.get('LOG_LEVEL')
    if env_log_level:
        numeric_level = getattr(logging, env_log_level.upper(), None)
        if isinstance(numeric_level, int):
            logging.getLogger().setLevel(numeric_level)
```

## Testing

The application has comprehensive test coverage:
- Over 98% code coverage
- Unit tests for all core components and operations
- Edge case testing (like division by zero)
- Mock objects for external dependencies
- Continuous integration through GitHub Actions

To run the tests:

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

## Future Enhancements

The following enhancements are planned:

1. Statistical operations
2. Calculation history management with Pandas
3. CSV data handling
4. Extended operation plugins

```
                      +--------------------+
                      |        App         |
                      | (Main Application) |
                      +--------+-----------+
                               |
                               v
       +-------------------------------------------+
       |              CommandHandler               |
       | (Processes and routes user commands)      |
       +---+-----------------+---------------+-----+
           |                 |               |

         |                   |               |
         v                   v               |
+--------+------+       +----+----+          |
| Operations    |       | Pandas   |          |
| (Add,Divide,  +<----->+ (Data    |          |
|  etc.)        |       | Handling) |          |
+---------------+       +-----------+          |
                               ^               |
                               |               |
                      +--------+--------------+
                      |    Results Processing  |
                      +------------------------+
```

This architecture provides:
1. **Loose coupling** between components
2. **High cohesion** within modules
3. **Extensibility** through the plugin system
4. **Maintainability** through clear separation of concerns

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/chelsy-s/midTerm.git
   cd midTerm
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Environment Variables

The application can be configured using these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |

```

## Design Patterns Implementation

The calculator applies several design patterns to create a maintainable, flexible architecture:

### Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates operations as objects, enabling:
- Parameterization of clients with different requests
- Queueing or logging of requests
- Support for undoable operations

**Implementation**: See [app/commands/__init__.py](app/commands/__init__.py)

### Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which classes to instantiate. This is implemented in the calculator operations.

**Implementation**: See [app/plugins/operations/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/__init__.py)

### Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. This is implemented in the history management module to provide a clean interface for Pandas operations.

**Implementation**: See [app/history/__init__.py](app/history/__init__.py)

### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern allows defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. This is implemented in the calculator operations.

**Implementation**: Each operation implements the same interface but with different algorithms.

### Plugin System

The application uses a dynamic plugin system to load command implementations at runtime.

**Implementation**: See [app/__init__.py](app/__init__.py)

This design allows for extending the application's functionality without modifying core code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

## Error Handling Approaches

The application demonstrates two complementary error handling approaches:

### Look Before You Leap (LBYL)

The LBYL approach checks conditions before performing an operation. This approach is implemented in the CommandHandler's execute_command_lbyl method.

### Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP)

The EAFP approach uses try/except to handle errors after they occur. This approach is implemented in the CommandHandler's execute_command_eafp method.

## Calculator Operations

The calculator implements basic arithmetic and statistical operations as plugins:

### Basic Operations

1. **Addition**: Adds two or more numbers together
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/add/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/add/__init__.py)

2. **Subtraction**: Subtracts numbers from the first operand
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/subtract/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/subtract/__init__.py)

3. **Multiplication**: Multiplies two or more numbers together
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/multiply/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/multiply/__init__.py)

4. **Division**: Divides the first operand by subsequent operands
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/divide/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/divide/__init__.py)
   - Special handling for division by zero

### Statistical Operations

5. **Mean**: Calculates the arithmetic mean (average) of multiple numbers
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/statistics/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/statistics/__init__.py)

6. **Median**: Calculates the median value of a set of numbers
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/statistics/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/statistics/__init__.py)

7. **Standard Deviation**: Calculates the sample standard deviation of a set of numbers
   - Implementation: [app/plugins/operations/statistics/__init__.py](app/plugins/operations/statistics/__init__.py)

Each operation implements validation to ensure proper arguments and error handling.

   - Implementation: [app/history/__init__.py](app/history/__init__.py)

2. **History Commands**: View, save, load, clear, and analyze history
   - Implementation: [app/history/commands.py](app/history/commands.py)

3. **CSV Integration**: Save and load history data in CSV format using Pandas
   - Default location: `data/history.csv`

4. **History Statistics**: Analyze usage patterns with operation frequency and timestamps

### History Command Examples

```
history           # Show all calculation history
history 5         # Show the last 5 entries
history-save      # Save history to default file
history-load      # Load history from default file
history-clear     # Clear all history entries
history-stats     # Show statistics about your calculations
history-search 5  # Search for entries containing "5"
```

### CSV Data Storage Format

The history data is stored in a structured CSV format with the following columns:

| Column Name | Description | Example Value |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier for each calculation | 1, 2, 3, ... |
| `timestamp` | Date and time when the calculation was performed | 2025-03-15 14:30:45 |
| `operation` | The operation that was performed | add, subtract, multiply, divide, mean, median, stddev, expression |
| `input` | The input parameters for the operation | 5 10 15 |
| `result` | The result of the calculation | 30.0 |

Example CSV content:
```csv
id,timestamp,operation,input,result
1,2025-03-15 14:30:45,add,"5 10 15",30.0
2,2025-03-15 14:31:20,multiply,"2 3 4",24.0
3,2025-03-15 14:32:05,expression,"5+10*2",25.0
```

This structured format enables:
- Easy import/export of calculation history
- Data analysis and visualization
- Filtering and searching of past calculations
- Generation of usage statistics

## Logging Implementation

The application implements a comprehensive logging system that:

1. Configures logging based on logging.conf file
2. Falls back to basic configuration if the file is missing
3. Adjusts log levels based on environment variables
4. Uses rotating file handlers to manage log size
5. Differentiates log messages by severity

**Implementation**: See [app/__init__.py](app/__init__.py) and [logging.conf](logging.conf)

The logging configuration file (`logging.conf`) defines:
- Multiple loggers (root and application-specific)
- Console and file handlers
- Different formatting for console vs. file output
- Rotation of log files to manage file size

## Data Handling with Pandas

The application uses Pandas for sophisticated data management:

1. **DataFrame Storage**: History is maintained in a structured Pandas DataFrame
2. **CSV Import/Export**: History can be saved to and loaded from CSV files
3. **Data Filtering**: Advanced filtering and search capabilities for history entries
4. **Statistics Generation**: Analysis of operation usage patterns

**Implementation**: See [app/history/__init__.py](app/history/__init__.py)

## Troubleshooting

Below are solutions to common issues you might encounter:

### Installation Issues

**Problem**: Dependencies fail to install  
**Solution**: Ensure you're using Python 3.10+ and try installing dependencies individually:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv==1.0.0
pip install pandas==2.1.0
# etc.
```

**Problem**: ModuleNotFoundError when running the application  
**Solution**: Verify that all dependencies are installed and you're running from the project root directory.

### Runtime Issues

**Problem**: History doesn't persist between sessions  
**Solution**: Use `history-save` before exiting and `history-load` when starting a new session.

**Problem**: "Invalid syntax" when entering an expression  
**Solution**: Ensure expressions follow the supported format. Complex expressions may require parentheses for proper order of operations.
